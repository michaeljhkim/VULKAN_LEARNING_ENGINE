- Octrees are used to split the game world into smaller and smaller pieces
- This is so that when collisions occur, we do not need to loop through every single object and check what exactly collided
- This section is currently the reason why my code is crashing. Newframe is processing and updating the octree, but something causes a segfault when sphere appears

- collision/bounding boxes do not rotate. This is less taxing on cpu

- octree update function is where segfault occurs. Not sure why


- MUST CONVERT POINTERS TO SMART POINTERS


- vulkan allows you to not bind anything UNTIL the very end. In the meantime, you create buffers and change up the buffer as needed

- CURRENTLY TRYING TO FIGURE OUT SHADER SYSTEMS IN VULKAN, AND HOW TO ADAPT THEM GIVEN THE CURRENT OPENGL SHADER SYSTEM
