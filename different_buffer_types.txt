The approach of allocating a larger buffer, copying data, and then deleting the old buffer is a common and efficient solution for dynamically resizing buffers, especially for scenarios like instance buffers where the data grows over time. However, there are alternative strategies that can improve performance, reduce the cost of resizing, or avoid resizing altogether, depending on the use case.

Here are a few alternative techniques:
1. Ring Buffer (Circular Buffer)

A ring buffer (or circular buffer) is an efficient way to handle a dynamically changing buffer without needing to resize the buffer as often. It works by reusing memory in a circular fashion, which helps avoid frequent reallocations.

    How it works: When the buffer is full, instead of reallocating, you just "wrap around" to the start of the buffer and overwrite the old data.
    Advantages:
        No need for resizing: Since you overwrite old data, you avoid the need to copy data and reallocate memory.
        Constant memory usage: The buffer size remains fixed, so memory is not allocated and freed dynamically.
    When to use: This technique is best suited when you're working with data that can be replaced in a continuous manner (such as with streaming data or cyclic operations), but may not be appropriate for cases where all data must be retained for later use.

2. Double or Triple Buffering

This approach involves using multiple buffers (e.g., two or three) to avoid constant resizing and to optimize for GPU access.

    How it works: You allocate multiple buffers, and when one buffer is filled, you start using the next one. This allows the GPU to continue rendering with one buffer while you update the other.
    Advantages:
        Avoids reallocations during runtime: Once the buffers are created, they remain at a fixed size and can hold a large number of instances.
        Efficient for frequent updates: You can update the non-active buffer while the active one is being processed by the GPU.
    When to use: This approach is ideal for cases where you need to perform frequent updates (like per-frame updates) without causing stuttering or waiting for allocations. However, it requires careful synchronization to ensure the CPU and GPU aren’t accessing the same buffer simultaneously.

3. Memory Pooling / Block Allocation

In memory pooling, you allocate a large block of memory up front, which you then divide into smaller chunks for specific tasks (like instances). You can manage these chunks in a way that allows for efficient reuse of memory without the need for frequent resizing.

    How it works: You allocate a large memory block at the start and manage it manually, dividing the memory into smaller "chunks" as needed. When a chunk is no longer in use, it’s returned to the pool.
    Advantages:
        Avoids frequent allocations and deallocations: Since memory is pre-allocated, you don’t need to reallocate frequently, which can reduce the overhead of memory management.
        Improved memory locality: Because the chunks are all part of a single large memory block, this can improve performance due to better memory locality.
    When to use: Memory pooling is most useful when the amount of memory required is relatively predictable, and you can afford to allocate a large block at the start. It's ideal for scenarios like game object pooling, where objects are reused frequently.

4. Sparse Resources (Sparse Buffers)

Sparse buffers (or sparse memory) allow for the allocation of large buffers where only a small subset of the memory is actively used. This can save memory in cases where only a small fraction of the allocated buffer is in use at any given time.

    How it works: Sparse buffers allocate memory in a way that only the necessary parts of the buffer are mapped into physical memory at a given time. When you need more space, you can "map" a new area of the buffer and use it.
    Advantages:
        Efficient memory usage: You don’t need to allocate large contiguous chunks of memory for all data. Only the parts you use are mapped, allowing you to save on memory.
        Flexible size: Sparse buffers can grow as needed, without the need to copy data into a larger buffer.
    When to use: This is useful when you need a large buffer but don’t need to use all of it at once (e.g., when working with large datasets with highly sparse usage).

5. Dynamic Memory Mapping with Persistent Mapping

Persistent mapping allows you to map GPU buffers into system memory and update the contents directly. With this method, the data can be updated without needing to unmap and remap the buffer constantly.

    How it works: The buffer is mapped once, and the system writes data to it directly in memory without needing to copy or resize the buffer.
    Advantages:
        Reduced CPU-GPU synchronization: Since you're writing to the buffer directly in memory, the overhead of synchronization and copying is minimized.
        Fast updates: You can directly update parts of the buffer as needed without copying everything over.
    When to use: This is useful when the buffer is updated frequently, and you need a low-latency update without the cost of frequent memory allocations or copies.

6. Fixed-size Buffers with Dynamic Offsets

Instead of resizing buffers, you can use fixed-size buffers and manage multiple sets of data using dynamic offsets.

    How it works: You create a buffer of a fixed size but manage where each new set of instance data is placed within the buffer. This approach involves keeping track of the offsets where new data can be written to the buffer.
    Advantages:
        No reallocations: Since the buffer size is fixed, you don’t need to resize it. You just write new data to the next available space.
        Efficient for managing multiple data streams: This method is efficient when you need to manage different sets of data (such as instance data for different models).
    When to use: This method works well if the buffer size is known ahead of time and you can predict the number of instances or data chunks you'll need. It’s useful when working with a manageable number of instances and data updates.
